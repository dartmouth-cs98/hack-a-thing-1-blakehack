    <p>
      Participation in a software engineering group project to meet a real-world
      need. Group members are responsible for all aspects of a software system,
      including iterative requirements analysis, design, implementation, and
      testing. The course also stresses customer interactions, documentation,
      process, and teamwork. The result is a software product of significant
      scope and significant benefit to a user base. Open only to students
      pursuing a major in Computer Science or a modified major with Computer
      Science as the primary part. 98.01 and 98.02 constitute a two course
      sequence, and they must be taken in consecutive terms, either fall/winter
      or winter/spring, normally in the senior year.
    </p>

    <h1 class="description">Prerequisite</h1>
    <p>
      At least two courses from COSC 50-69 or at least three courses from COSC
      50-89, or permission of instructor.

    <h1 class="description">Project Course Overview</h1>

    <p>
      In this course you will have the freedom to pitch and develop your own
      project idea. It is your time to spend two terms to create your own
      startup product. The first class meetings will be devoted to short
      technology hackathons, brainstorming sessions, and choosing your product
      teams. You will be encouraged to be creative and push yourselves
      technically, but simultaneously to keep your project scope feasible. Often
      the most successful projects start out as a small, clever idea, while
      projects that are overly ambitious will prevent you from thoroughly
      investigating the concept.
      <br />
      <br />
      Some things to consider while thinking about project ideas:

      <ul>
       <li>
Novelty: The purpose of this course is to broaden your experience as a developer. It is an opportunity to investigate a
novel idea in a team environment, from initial concept, through all stages of design & development, to delivery of a
functional final product. Your project must be a fresh idea, introduced solely for this course. It should not be a
continuation of an internship, previous course project, or existing startup.
       </li>
       <li>
 Format: You may choose any format relevant to software design & implementation. For example, your team may choose to
 develop a game, a web or mobile app, or even experiment with IoT.
       </li>
       <li>
        Impact: Your project should demonstrate a positive impact and offer clear benefit to a user base. Consider themes such
        as education, research, health care, or environmental protection and improvement. Think outside of what is useful to
        Dartmouth students - new event apps, social network clones, and marketplaces have been attempted before and you might
        find it more rewarding to build something that challenges you.
       </li>
      </ul>
