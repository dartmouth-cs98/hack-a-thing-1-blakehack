### Short description of what you attempted to build:
I had zero background in web development, so I aimed to learn as much HTML and CSS as I could.  I had originally intended on learning React, but discovered I'd need experience with HTML, CSS, and Javascript first.   The main focus was to soak up as much information as possible, the secondary objective was to make a website to demonstrate some of these things. I started aiming to copy the course webpage, but found that to be rather tedious and I did not have enough time after completing the tutorial I went through, and I did my best to show some functionality and use some of the things I learned in the tutorial.  

### Who did what:
I did all of it.

### What you learned:
I learned (including but not limited to) all of the basics of HTML: Images, lists, Tables and Forms, Internal/External CSS, Color Properties, Typography, Block Elements, Display:flex, Pseudo Elements, Selectors, Transformations, Animations, Shadows, as well as many shortcuts and workflow tips.

### What Didn't Work:
I spent a lot of time in the learning phase and did not leave enough time for the building of an actual project.  The tutorial I started with was 11.5 hours (which ultimately took longer than that to actually write the code being demonstrated), and while I learned a lot with it, most of it was one page demonstrations of a single features one at a time that I deleted as I went.

It was definitely a useful skill to learn and I'm looking forward to sharpen these skills as we get into the projects.
